# GOV.UK-Challenge
An app which helps the GOV.UK page a lot simpler and easier for users to use. 
Features include:
-A forward button, so you can send articles to other people
-A translate button, so it can help people who don't understand english read articles in their own languages
-A list button, which pressed, leads to a page with all the viewed articles a user has seen and a user can view articles they have liked and favorited.
