An app which helps the GOV.UK page a lot simpler and easier for users to use. It makes it easier by focusing on 10 services: The NHS, Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Driving Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), The Home Office, Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department for Education (DfE), Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Department of Transport (DfT) and Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
